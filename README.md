There are many ways through which we can help Sunita Sharma 65-year-old women. One of the ways is using technology, nowadays there are lots of technical devices available in market which calculates their heart rate, Blood pressure, etc. Loneliness is again the most important factors that effect elderly person health, if they are engaged with other people that will make them feel livelier, I had seen one video on youtube where elderly man who lost his wife had going through depression but his son bought a dog for his father and that completely changes his fatherâ€™s condition, he used to take him to the walk play with him he started feeling lively. Daily routine is also a very important factor for healthy life, wake up time, yoga or exercise, everything matters.

Here is a daily routine I have made,

Wake up at 6:00 am.

Take a walk for 30 min i.e., 6:15 -6:45am.

Yoga or warmup exercise for 30 min (7:00-7:30am)
